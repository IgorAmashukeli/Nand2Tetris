Electricity:

1) Take copper and create wire

2) Take water

3) Take sulfuric adic, add to water - now we can 

4) Put Cu and Zn to different part of sulfuric acid

|    Zn    Cu    |
|                |
|                |
|                |
|    H_2 - O     |
|  H_2 - S - O_4 |
------------------

5) Zink is ion-active. It starts to give ions: 2 Zn -> Zn_2+ + 2e-.
 There are a lot of electrons in Cu. It is called Anode.

6) Cu is not ion-active. There are few electrons in Cu. It is called Cathode.

7) Now let's connect Zn and Cu with copper wire.

8) Electrons will move from Zn, which is "-" towards Cu, which is "+"

9) We created owr own battery, flow and power supply!
