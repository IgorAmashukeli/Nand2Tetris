P-N junction:

1)  Let's build P-semiconductor and N-semiconductor from previous chapter.


2)  N-semiconductor has redundant free electrones "e".
    P-semiconductor has redundant free holes "h".

    P-semiconductor          N-semiconductor
[Si h Si h ... Si h Si h Si ][ Si e Si e Si ... e Si e Si]


3) Now let's connect those two semiconductors.


Free electrons from N-semiconductor will fit the places of holes in P-semiconductor.
But, not all electrons are able to reach far holes.
Therefore, after filling the nearest holes there creates a region between them:

[Si h Si ... h Si h ][Si Si Si Si][e Si e ... e Si e Si]

It is called depletion region

4) Now let's add electric field to the electric circuit:

"+" to N-semiconductor
"-" to P-semiconductor

"-"[Si h Si ... h Si h ][Si Si Si Si][e Si e ... e Si e Si]"+"

Now 
- in P-semiconductor electrons will move to the right
- in N-semiconductor electrons will move to the right -> holes will move to the left

The region will grow:

"-"[Si h h ... h Si][Si Si Si Si Si Si][ Si e... e e Si]"+"

5) Now let's add flow in another direction:

"+" to P-semiconductor
"-" to N-semiconductor

"+"[Si h Si ... h Si h ][Si Si Si Si][e Si e ... e Si e Si]"-"

Now
- in P-semiconductor electrons will move to the left
- in N-semiconductor electrons will move to the left -> holes will move to the right

The region will shrink

"+"[Si Si ... h Si h h][Si][e e e ... e Si e Si]"-"

and electrones will flow left to the right, then they will enter circuit,
go full circle and enter from the right

6) We create p-n junction flow from electric field 
(which can be from an electric flow).

That means we know, how to create one flow if and only if there is another flow!
