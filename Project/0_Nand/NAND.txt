NAND

0 represents no flow
1 represents flow

1) Let's take NMOS and PMOS transistors

NMOS:
          |     Terminal 1 = out
        __|
       |
Gate --|
       |_
         |
         |
       -----
        ---    Terminal 2 = ground
         -

If Gate is 0, then there is no flow from out to the ground
If Gate is 1, then there is a flow from out to the ground

PMOS:

          ^
          |     Terminal 1 = voltage
        __|
       |
Gate o-|
       |_
         |
         |
            Terminal 2 = out
         
If Gate is 0, then there is a flow from voltage to the out
If Gate is 1, then there is no flow from voltafe to the out


2) Now let's look at that scheme:

                                        voltage
                                          ^
    ___________________________           |
    |                          |        __|
    |                          |       |
    |                voltage   | - o - | PMOS
    |                  ^               |_
    |                  |                 |
    |                __|                 |
    |               |                    |
A - |---------- o - |  PMOS              |
    |     |         |_                   |
B - |     |           |                  |
    |     |           |__________________|
    |     |                     |
    |     |                     |_________________ C
    |     |                     |
    |     |                     |
    |     |                     |
    |     |                  ___|
    |     |                 |
    |     |---------------  | NMOS
    |                       |___
    |                           |
    |                           |
    |                           |
    |                       ____
    |                       |
    |---------------------  | NMOS
                            |___
                               |
                               |
                               |
                             -----
                              ---
                               - ground  


3) Let's compute C, depending on A and B:

- A = 0, B = 0
  There is a flow through both PMOS, and there is no flow in both NMOS
  C is connected through both of the PMOS to the voltage and not connected to the ground because of fully open path through NMOS
  C is connected to voltage, but no to the ground
  C = 1


- A = 0, B = 1
  There is a flow at least through one of the PMOS and there at most one NMOS without flow
  C is connected through one of the PMOS to the voltage and not connected to the ground because of partly open path through NMOS
  C is again connected to volage, but no to the ground
  C = 1


- A = 1, B = 0
  There is a flow at least through one (now another) of the PMOS and there at most one NMOS (now another) without flow
  C is connected through one of the PMOS to the voltage and not connected to the ground because of partly open path through NMOS
  C is again connected to volage, but no to the ground
  C = 1


- A = 1, B = 1
  There is no flow through the PMOS and there is a flow through all of the NMOS
  C is not connected to the voltage through any PMOS, but is connected to the ground because of fully closed path through NMOS
  C is not connected to the volage, but connected to the ground
  C = 0

  These scheme creates NAND function

       _______
  A __|       \
    __|  NAND  |o ------ C
  B   |_______/


We built our NAND gate! (in theory)
In practice we are using software simulation.
We don't have transistors => we will use builtin version of NAND.
