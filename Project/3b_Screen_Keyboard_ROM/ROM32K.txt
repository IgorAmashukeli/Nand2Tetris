Let's take read-obly (load = zero) RAM32K:

CHIP RAM32K {
    IN in[16], load, address[15];
    OUT out[16];

    PARTS:
    False(in=load, out=zero);
    RAM16K(in=in, load=zero, address=address[0..13], out=out1);
    RAM16K(in=in, load=zero, address=address[0..13], out=out2);
    Mux(a=out1, b=out2, sel=address[14], out=out);
}

Let's take the program writen in machine code
(< 32K lines of code, each line is 16 bit word, each word is 1/0 flow, 
each one is of this bits is controlled by a mechanical gate,
At first each gate is open (no flow in all lines)
each gate is manipulated mannually, according to machine code (if 1, we close, else open)
).
We create ROM32K memory for program text.
