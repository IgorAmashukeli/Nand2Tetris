Let's take Quartz crystal.
Let's take resistor, 2 capacitors, inverter.

Let's create this circuit:

Quartz crystal will generate oscillations.
However they tend to attenuation.
To prevent this from happening we will add amplifier to "save" quartz from attenuation.
This amplifier can be for example CMOS NOT inventor, that consists of transisors.
Transistors are not also depletion elements, but also enhancing.
Connecting quartz crystal to NOT gate will increase amplifier.
However, there is a problem. The inverter will create 180 degree phase shift.
To revert to 360 degrees we add 2 capacitors.
The resistor is used to stabilize feedback.

The crystal, at a frequency just slightly above its "series resonant" frequency, looks like an inductor of a certain value.
That inductor, resonating with the two shunt capacitors, winds up acting like a 180 degree phase inverter.
By connecting a transistor stage (common emitter mode) driven by the crystal output and "feeding back" to the input side of the crystal,
the transistor both amplifies the signal and adds its own 180 degree phase shift for a total shift of 360 degrees.

In the output we create two inverters to create positive gain (amplify even more).
For that we create a feedback loop with a resistor to stablize.
(The third inverter connects to the output of the second inverter and returns to its own input via resistors and capacitors,
 forming a so-called Schmitt trigger with positive feedback.
 Feedback allows you to keep the vibrations at the quartz resonant frequency and form a stable and accurate signal with the desired frequency.)

The second inverter is used as a buffer element.
It receives the signal from the first inverter (which is connected to the crystal)
and provides isolation between the crystal and the Schmitt trigger so as not to affect the sensitive frequency of quartz.

We also create a resistor aftet the inverter to have stability.

Because, of the discrete nature of logic NOT gate inverter,
we will get a very stable square wave, instead of sinusoid, which have high, low value,
constant amplitude and frequency, thus discreting the continuos flow of the time by its signal.
