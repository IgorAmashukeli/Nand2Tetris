Let's take quartz Si - O_2.
Let's take some methal.
Let's create Quartz crystal element.

As you can learn, a simple LC
circuit can be used for generation of a signal.

But, the attenuation of oscillations is very high.
Therefore, it is very unstable to use this LC circuit to generate any oscillations.

Quartz crystal is piezo-electric.
That means, quartz can convert mechanical vibrations to voltage and voltage to mechanical vibration.
That means, that quartz can be used as oscillation circuit (almoust like LC).

Moreover, quartz has exceptionally high Q (which is inversely proportional to the
 rate of attenuation of natural oscillations in the system. 
That is, the higher the Q-factor of the oscillatory system,
 the less energy loss for each period and the slower the oscillations fade).

 However, we can't generate the oscillations just using the Quartz crystal,
  cause there will be attenuations.
