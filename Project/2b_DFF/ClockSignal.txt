Let's take crystal oscilator.
The crystal oscilator is called Clock.
It will have this ouput signal.
The output is called clock signal.
As we know, crystal oscilator outputs square wave form of clock signal.

[   0   ][   1   ][   2   ][   3   ][   4   ][   5   ][   6   ][   7   ]...


The high value is called "high".
The low value is called "low".
The edge between low and high value is called leading edge.
The edge between high and low value is called falling edge.
The phase from start of one "low" value to the next is called time unit.
Now if we are going to built a gate with a simple input and a Clock, it will be called sequential.
Now for each time unit, the input can be different.
And the output for each time unit can be also different.
However, there can be a delay in the voltage. Thus, leading to a delay in output.
How to deal with this? Well, we can do it by mantaining two conditions:

- we will only check the output after each unit passes

- we will create the clock with such a frequency,
 so it will have a time unit bigger than any delay in computation.
